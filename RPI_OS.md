## Installing Devuan on the RPI 4
In order to install it, we need to download first the arm image so we can burn it on the SD card. We going to download the image by going in this link:

https://arm-files.devuan.org

We going to choose the desired image and make sure the image its for the same model of our RaspberryPi. In my case it's going to be
    
    devuan_beowulf_3.1.0_arm64_rpi4.img.zip           04-Mar-2021 22:46    573M
    
Because my RaspberryPi model is 4 and also I prefer the beowulf version in Devuan.
